<p>
1. It has autocomplete, which is actually pretty helpful. Other's had this as well, but I just wanted to mention this. :D
2. It checks your spelling. I don't know if this is such a big deal, but I think this might come in handy one day.
3. When you write the left curly bracket it automatically sets the right one as well.
